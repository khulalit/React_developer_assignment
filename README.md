# React App Functionality Overview

## Features

### 1. Infinite Scrolling

The app incorporates an infinite scrolling mechanism to provide a seamless and dynamic browsing experience. As the user scrolls down, additional content is loaded, ensuring a continuous flow of information without the need for manual pagination.

### 2. Search Field

A search functionality is integrated, allowing users to quickly locate specific content or courses. The search field provides a convenient way to filter and find relevant information within the app.

### 3. Email Login

This app has a login page where user can add email and will be taken to dashboard where student can access their courses. This is just mock no react auth.

### 4. Dashboard Access

Upon successful login, users gain access to a personalized dashboard. This dashboard serves as a central hub for managing various aspects of the user's experience, including enrolled courses, progress tracking, and other relevant information.

### 5. List of Enrolled Courses

The dashboard prominently displays a list of courses in which the user is currently enrolled. This feature enhances user convenience by providing quick access to ongoing educational content.

### 6. Mark as Complete Button

To track course progress, a "Mark as Complete" button is implemented. Users can easily update their course status, allowing for efficient monitoring of completed coursework and facilitating a sense of accomplishment.

## Backend Integration

To support these features, a custom backend has been developed wich took my time. This backend is responsible for handling user authentication, managing course data, and serving content to the frontend. The backend ensures a secure and reliable connection between the frontend and the server.

## Deployment

The entire application, including both the frontend and backend, has been successfully deployed. Users can access the app from any device with an internet connection, providing a flexible and accessible learning environment.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
